The 'aggressive better' is far more efficient at winning than the pure random agent
explanation : it never misses a good opportunity to bet even if it means losing some money
on the other hand, pure random agents make bad choices half of the time whereas the greedy agent
might make a rather good move.

The heuristic-guided agent (so-called smart agent) is also more prone to winning, more often and for
higher margins than pure random agents. Compared to one random agent and one greedy agent (trial #4), it
seems the heuristic-guided agent outperforms both other agents. The trial #5 shows the smart agent
outperforms two greedy opposing agents in the same proportion, doubling the number of game won and getting
an average gain twice the average gain of the greedy agents.

trials:
trial #1 four random agents (control)
trial #2 three random agents, one greedy agent
trial #3 three random agents, one smart agent
trial #4 one smart agent, one greedy agent and one random
trial #5 one smart agent, three greedy
